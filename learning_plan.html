            <H2>•	What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</H2>

                <p>To eventually develop an app linked to my passion, stormchasing. While this will probably only ever be a side project I would also really love to work on a start up.</p>

            <h2>•	A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning</h2>

            <p>I recently completed a myers briggs quiz which came back as <i>INTP-A.</i> Reading these traits it good to see alot show my strengths which can be applied to learning</p>
                
                <Div class="briggs">

                    <p><b>Seek to develop logical explanations for everything that interests them. Theoretical and abstract, interested more in ideas than in social interaction.</p>
                    <p>Quiet, contained, flexible, and adaptable. Have unusual ability to focus in depth to solve problems in their area of interest. 
                    Skeptical, sometimes critical, always analytical.<b>
                    </p>

                    <p>I believe I thrive off training using real-world examples rather than solely in a classroom where my mind can wander and think about what am I going to do when dogecoin gets to $1…</p>
            <br>
            <h2>•	What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h2> 
            
                <p>Patience with others who may not understand something and being pushed to my full abllity. Sometimes I can hold back as I don’t want the extra attention that doing well can bring, as stupid as the sounds!</p>
            <br>
            <h2>•	A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme</h2>
                <p>Approach everything with a positive mindset and keep on track at the task on hand. Not get too focused on one thing. When things do become over whelming look at taking regaulr breaks. Keepin up exercise and good sleep patterns help with keeping on top of things aswell.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>•	A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h2>
                <p>Keep to time box recommendations, seek advice from the facilators and peers on the course on how to keep on track.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>•	A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h2>
                <p>To provide help and support. Picking up on my weakness and advising me where I may need to strengthen my work but also be honest with what I am doing.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>•	Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things</h2>
                <p>Currently I have no commitments outside of this course other than normal family commitments. When the bootcamp begins I will be away from home with my sole focus being the course.</p>
