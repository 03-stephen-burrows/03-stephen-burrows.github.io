                    <H2>Problem Solving Techniques and Processes</H2>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Pseudocode – Writing out code in plain English, before you write your code</li>
                            <li>Rubber ducky method – Don’t understand, talk to a rubber duck, a cat or someone else. Often saying it out loud allows you to understand it better</li>
                            <li>Reading error messages – Don’t understand the message, google it or keywords in the error to find a solution</li>
                            <li>Console log – One of JavaScript’s most common approaches to troubleshoot is to log stuff utilizing console.log(); I don’t use this enough, but if it works for you go for it. console.log();</li>
                            <li>Googling – My number one choice. Don’t know “google it” </li>
                            <li>Asking your peers for help – Great option when you know the grasp on a topic is better than your own</li>
                            <li>Asking coaches for help – Ask and you shall receive. They are a wealth of knowledge</li>
                            <li>Improving your process with reflection – My worst of the list, I need to take more notes</li>
                        </ul>
                
                            <H2>Problem: While completing a replit</H2> 

                        <p>    
                            Gradebook, I got stuck on one of the questions on what I should be writing to pass the task.

                        <H2>Problem solving techniques</H2>

                        <p>
                            Googling keywords and talking things over with peers and a friend who work as a senior dev. When I can’t get something to work, I can get very frustrated so have to also take a break, make a coffee etc Then come back with a fresh mindset. Take regular breaks!
