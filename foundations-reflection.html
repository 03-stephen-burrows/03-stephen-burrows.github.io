                    <H2>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</H2>
                       
                    <ul>
                        <li>I need to take more breaks when im stuck problem solving. Dont let the frustration get to me</li>
                        <li>Regualr reflection is good for the mind</li>
                        <li>But mostly what I learnt solidified what I knew about myself, my values and mindset before coming into this course. </li>
                        
                    </ul>

                    <H2>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</H2>                        
                        <p>Understanding and being aware of my own values enable me to maximise my learning. It is important to be aware of ethical and moral considerations when programming and working with others. Combining this will enable me to pickup skills that will help carry out tasks with responsibility.</p>

                    <H2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</H2>
                        <p>If was refreshing from looking at code all day!    
                        </p>

                    <H2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</H2>
                        <p>In the early days finding the relevance of it but as the course went on I found that it had a place. Also writing a journal, I have never done this before and struggled with it, often I completely forgot too do this as it didnt come naturally to me. 
                        </p>

                    <H2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</H2>
                        <p>To make there students more employable once the course is completed. A graduant with skills with added enpathy, self awareness and good ethical values will be better than just a grad with skills.    
                        </p>

                    <H2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practising programming instead? Justify your answer.</H2>
                        <p>As I mentioned above its releavance to the course in the early days. But as time went on I saw its place. A couple of times I spent to long on core and that impacted the tech side, so for a couple weeks I did the tech first then the core and that helped.
