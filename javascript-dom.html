                    <p>HTML is the bones, lets say a car with no paint. Then we add CSS this is the coloring and style being added.</p>

                        <p>Control Flow is the order in which the computer generally executes code in a script, top to bottom. This is the default. Looping effectively executes the same code multiple times untill a stopping condition is meet. This will contine until all the conditions are meet</p>

                            The DOM is an acronym for "Document Object Model". We use the DOM when we interact with Webpages. Add, delete and change content in a HTML documnet.

                        <p
                        >Arrays are sets of data between [square, brackets] separated by commas. This is a great way to store collections and lists that are accessed by their position within that list. To access the array we use zero-based indexing, so the first item in an array is 0, the second item is 1, the third is 2 etc.
                    </p> 
                            <p>
                                Objects are sets of data between { curly brackets }. The data contained with an object represents a ‘thing’ like a car, person etc. These things then have properties, fields and methods. If the object was a person that data would be name, age, skin colour, height etc. The methods could be what the person can do: Good at coding
                            </p>
                                <p>
                                    While arrays are accessed data according to their position, an object does so by referencing one of the values.

                                        Functions is a set of statements that preforms a task or calculates a value. These functions can have inputs. The function doesn’t need to be written over and over again, only the input changed.
